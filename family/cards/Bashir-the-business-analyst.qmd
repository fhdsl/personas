-   Bashir **needs** access to analysis-ready data and a tool to visualize and break down data as needed 
-   He **struggles** with understanding what data definitions are used when and with making sure he is using the best and most comprehensive data to answer his questions 
-   **We can help** him by giving him broader access to curated data sets and by helping his colleagues streamline curated dataset creation

## Bashir needs comprehensive, well-documented data to drive decision-making 

Bashir is tasked with being an expert in a discrete data area or data system and improvement efforts associated with that area (for example, clinical trials, patient safety reporting, Press Ganey, etc.) He wants to answer critical questions for clinical leaders like Lisa, and identify opportunities for growth that could contribute to the Hutch’s mission of providing excellent care and doing impactful science. How are patient safety issues changing over time? How can we most efficiently use our clinical capacity? To answer these questions, Bashir needs to work with stakeholders to figure out what they're really asking for, then pull together **tables or visualizations of data from multiple sources** (e.g., clinical care, claims and insurance data, clinical trials data, operations data). Rather than work with raw data in SQL or other languages, Bashir gets Tableau visualizations or Excel datasets either from his own sources (e.g., a patient safety portal) or from the Clinical Analytics Team or DPT. Although he doesn’t want to delve too much into the raw data, for some questions he’d love **an easy way to play with a broader set of analysis-ready data** so that he can get more data easily when he needs it. Sometimes Bashir spots **discrepancies between different visualizations or datasets**. He may or may not be able to access the raw data, so he needs some back and forth with other teams to understand the source of the discrepancy. More consistent definitions across visualizations and datasets might save him some time.

# Key Challenges

-   Not having access to the right data
-   Manually merging data from different sources in Excel
-   Understanding the data definitions of objects on dashboards built by other teams 
-   Not having access to the raw data to dig in deeper when necessary


# Needs and Wants

-   A way to get clean, processed data on demand that is ready to analyze, without coding
-   A way to get (or easily build without coding) custom visualizations on demand to help answer critical questions  


# Types of data used

-   Clinical care data 
-   Claims and payment data 
-   Clinical operations data 
-   Press Ganey data
-   Internal data sources (e.g., patient safety reporting data)
-   Cancer registry data
-   Chart abstracted data
