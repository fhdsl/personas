-   Melissa needs to **access** data about clinical operations and quality-related incidents to assess and improve clinical operations.
-   She **struggles** to access additional datasets needed for reporting and to work quickly and adeptly with current data systems.
-   **We can help her** by making new datasets discoverable and by providing her team a way to create and document curated datasets to monitor operations, investigate incidents, and make quality improvement plans.
-   **In Hutch**: 20-ish people in Clinical Operations.

## Melissa needs a unified data source and code repository to speed up quality improvements

Melissa wants to help things run smoothly at Fred Hutch, and she does that by monitoring clinical operations and reporting on quality improvement strategies. What percentage of patients have filled out patient-reported outcomes? How many patients are referred to Fred Hutch for cancer treatment? How many medical errors or near misses have there been in the last month? Melissa needs to answer all these questions and more, pulling data from multiple systems like Epic EHR data, Sunquest lab data, cancer registry data (CNeXT), and even data from phone systems. With so many data sources structured in different ways, there are many possible "sources of truth". Melissa needs ot both define what she's looking for and figure out where to get it. But getting data from so many different sources can take a lot of time. Melissa needs data in a central platform, structured in a way that makes sense for her work. Since she'll never get all the data she needs in one place, she needs to be able to easily join curated datasets to raw data from Epic's warehouse, or even to excel sheets of chart abstracted data from stakeholders, as needed. And after all the work that goes into defining what data to get, Melissa needs a central repository for code snippets and the definitions and documentation associated with data objects so she can share them with her colleagues and make sure everyone is using the right "source of truth" for a given project. It would also save her time to automate Tableau reports, and if her colleagues could automate the production of reports in Epic's in-application reporting tools.

# Key Challenges

-   Identifying the most accurate source of truth when multiple options are in play
-   Missing data in the clinical analytics database, necessitating importing data from other platforms (e.g., importing data from DAWG and combining it with the data reporting object when necessary)
-   Understanding the landscape of data from FHCC clinical applications that is not available in DAWG or visible on the FH side
-   Ensuring that all stakeholders both within and outside of the team are using the same reference data and data definitions, and resolving confusion when discrepancies occur
-   Assessing the limits of reliability and quality of datasets or data dictionaries (e.g., Epic fields may not be used in practice the way they are defined in the dictionary)
-   Clearly supporting QI/QA projects and identifying when they become research and need review by the IRB
-   Providing requesters with what they need with a very short turnaround time
-   Inconsistency in the way that clinical providers and staff enter data into epic, making it harder for analysts to determine which epic fields to query (e.g., there is more than one comment field in Epic and clinical comments may appear in any of them)
